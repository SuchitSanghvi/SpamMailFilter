Algorithm for Training

While training we have to take Training Dataset

Step 1: Take Body of the Email in String 
Step 2: allword //Combine in one string
Step 3: freqofwords = freqdata(allword) //check out the frequency of the words
Step 4: Pr(wi|S) = freqof(wi)inspam/no_of_spammail
	do this for each word
Step 5: Pr(wi|H) = freqof(wi)inham/no_of_hammail
	do this for each word
Step 6: Store this Pr(wi|S) and Pr(wi|H) in Excel File

Algorithm for Testing

Input is the mail(E)

Step 1: words (words of body)
Step 2: freqofwords = freqdata(allword)
Step 3: Pr(E|S) = productforeachword(Pr(wi|S) * freqof(wi)) 
	//Pr(wi|S) from trained dataset from excel and current frequency of that word in E
Step 4: Pr(E|H) = productforeachword(Pr(wi|H) * freqof(wi)) 
	//Pr(wi|H) from trained dataset from excel and current frequency of that word in E
Step 5: Calculate Pr(E|S)*Pr(S)
Step 6: Calculate Pr(E|H)*Pr(H)
Step 7: ratio = Pr(E|S)*Pr(S)/Pr(E|H)*Pr(H)
Step 8: range = log(ratio)
Step 9: if(range>0) then 
	E = spam
	else
	E = ham
